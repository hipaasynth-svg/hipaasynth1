"""Polymorphic fairness metrics for the HipAAsynth engine.

These metrics quantify how a model's clinical decisions vary across the seven
polymorphic forms of the same synthetic patient.  They are designed to surface
bias that only appears when the same clinical content is expressed through
different documentation styles and information sources.
