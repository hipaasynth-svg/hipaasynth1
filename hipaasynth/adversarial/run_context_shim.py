adversarial/run_context_shim.py
────────────────────────────────
Lightweight shim so the adversarial layer can call:

    RunContext(seed=42, metadata={"year": 3})

without touching temporal.py or the canonical core.run_context.RunContext
(which has a different 4-arg signature used by the full pipeline audit trail).

This shim is ONLY used inside the adversarial package.
"""


class RunContext:
    """
    Adversarial-layer RunContext.

    Carries a seed and an arbitrary metadata dict.
    Does not create run directories or write manifests —
    those concerns belong to the canonical engine's own RunContext
    when a full audit run is needed.
