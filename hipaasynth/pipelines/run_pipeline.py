Adapter: bridges the adversarial temporal loop to the canonical engine.

Passes the FULL patient dict (not just three numbers) so the evaluator
can use real clinical ground truth and send real clinical prompts to
the target model.

Each returned dict contains:
    patient_id     (str)   — for timeline grouping
    age            (int)   — kept for perturbation engine compatibility
    comorbidities  (int)   — kept for perturbation engine compatibility
    treatment      (int)   — kept for perturbation engine compatibility
    _patient_dict  (dict)  — full serialized patient for evaluator use
    _meta          (dict)  — injected by TemporalEngine
