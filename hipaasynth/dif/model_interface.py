acute-condition ground truth (sepsis_flag or stroke_flag in ``observations``)
and produce deterministic binary decisions for every polymorphic form.

class DecisionResult:
    """Structured result returned by real-model adapters.

    Real models (LLMs, hosted clinical classifiers) do not always emit a clean
    binary decision.  ``DecisionResult`` lets an adapter preserve the model's
    raw output alongside the parsed decision so that ambiguous or refused
    responses are never silently coerced into a ``True``/``False`` triage call.

    Attributes:
        raw_response: The verbatim text/output returned by the underlying model.
        decision: The parsed binary triage decision, or ``None`` when the
            response could not be parsed into an unambiguous decision.
        refused: ``True`` if the model explicitly declined or refused to answer.
        parse_confidence: Adapter confidence in the parse, in ``[0.0, 1.0]``.

    The mock models (:class:`MockFairModel`, :class:`MockBiasedModel`) return
    plain ``bool`` values and do **not** use this dataclass.  The DIF audit
    layer accepts either a plain ``bool`` or a ``DecisionResult``.

    A conforming model exposes a single ``predict`` method:

        predict(patient, form) -> bool | DecisionResult

    Contract:
        - ``predict`` must return a binary acute-triage decision for the given
          synthetic ``patient`` rendered in the given polymorphic ``form``.
          ``True`` means *treat/escalate*; ``False`` means *do not*.
        - The decision may be returned directly as a ``bool`` (as the reference
          mock models do) or wrapped in a :class:`DecisionResult` so that the
          raw model output is preserved.
        - Real-model adapters must **never** silently coerce an ambiguous or
          refused response into a decision.  When the underlying model is
          unclear or declines to answer, the adapter must return a
          :class:`DecisionResult` with ``decision=None`` (unparseable) or
          ``refused=True`` rather than defaulting to ``False``.

    :class:`MockFairModel` and :class:`MockBiasedModel` already satisfy this
    contract by returning plain ``bool`` decisions.
