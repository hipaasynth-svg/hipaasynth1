## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-29

First stable release of the HipAAsynth engine — the open-source (AGPL v3)
fairness-testing core for clinical AI accountability. This release marks the
completion of the 7-Axis Adversarial Stress Test (7AAST) framework and a
verified, fully reproducible calibration baseline.

### Added

#### 7AAST framework

- **7-Axis Adversarial Stress Test (7AAST)** completed — all seven axes
  implemented and tested:
  - Axes 1–4: polymorphic fairness metrics (DCS, ISG, LFDI, SAF) via the DIF
    module.
  - Axis 5: adversarial perturbation (noise injection, missingness, temporal
    drift).
  - **Axis 6 — PSF (Population Sparsity Fairness)**, new in this release.
    Sparsity levels S1–S7; key metric Sparsity Degradation Index (SDI), FAIL if
    SDI < 0.80. Calibrated to the IHS Data Governance Framework (2022), Sequist
    (NEJM 2021), and Adler-Milstein (Health Aff 2017).
  - **Axis 7 — CC (Care Continuity)**, new in this release. Continuity profiles
    PROFILE_A through PROFILE_D; key metric Continuity Degradation Index (CDI),
    FAIL if CDI < 0.80, plus matched-pair transition-consistency analysis.
    Calibrated to Roberts (Health Aff 2018), AHRQ Statistical Brief #179, and
    HRSA (2023).

#### Clinical modules

- **6 calibrated clinical modules**: Stroke, Sepsis, COPD, CHF, OUD, and
  Diabetes. Each generates deterministic synthetic cohorts from anchor seeds.

#### Polymorphic engine and fairness audit

- **Polymorphic form engine** rendering each synthetic patient in 7 distinct
  documentation forms (FHIR structured, physician SOAP, mid-level abbreviated,
  patient high-literacy, patient low-literacy, LEP-translated, and CHW SDoH-rich).
- **DIF fairness audit** producing a per-patient FairnessPassport with four
  metrics: DCS (Decision Consistency Score), ISG (Information-Source Gradient),
  LFDI (Linguistic-Form Disadvantage Index), and SAF (SDoH Amplification Factor),
  each with a pass/fail determination.
- **Regulatory mapping** to the FDA Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC) framework and
  the EU AI Act.
- **Exporters** for JSON, CSV, and FHIR R5.

#### Calibration

- **17/17 calibration targets verified** against published reference
  distributions (CDC BRFSS, ACS, and IHS benchmarks), confirming that synthetic
  cohort distributions match their real-world anchors within tolerance.

#### Testing and architecture

- **54 automated tests passing**, 0 failures.
- **Zero external dependencies** — the engine runs on the pure Python standard
  library. This is enforced in CI by an AST-based import check that fails the
  build if any non-stdlib import is introduced.

### Infrastructure

- **GitHub branch protection and CI** configured. The `test.yml` workflow runs
  the full test suite on Python 3.11 and 3.12 and enforces the zero-external-
  dependency invariant on every push and pull request.
- **Privacy and professionalism audit completed.** The codebase contains no
  named individuals and no real facilities — only synthetic populations and
  region-level population anchors.

### Release provenance

- This v1.0.0 release is timestamped via **OpenTimestamps Bitcoin anchoring** as
  part of the **CAP (Certification Artifact Pipeline)**. The release artifact is
  fixed to a **SHA-256 anchor chain** and anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain,
  producing an independently verifiable proof of existence for the release.
  (The CAP pipeline itself is offered as a proprietary certification service and
  is not part of this open-source repository — see `README.md`.)

### Licensing

- **Dual-license model.** The engine and all core modules are published under
  **AGPL-3.0**. A **commercial license** is available for organizations that
  cannot meet the AGPL v3 source-disclosure obligations — see
  [COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md](COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md).
